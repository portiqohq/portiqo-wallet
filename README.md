# vibe-startup
We're building a hardware startup in 30 days with vibes and $1000.

Our product brings modern access control features to legacy buildings without replacing existing hardware. Users manage their RFID credentials through a mobile app and programmable emulator, while building admins get cloud-based tools for issuing, revoking, and securing access.
